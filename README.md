bits/stdc++.h header for anyone needs
I got a problem with terminal input in VS Code on OSX, after a long time to try, I get back to code C++ with Xcode, it get another error "bits/stdc++.h header not found. So I create this one hope helping anyone still getting this error. 
---> Just download it. Go to Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/MacOSX.platform/Developer/SDKs/MacOSX.sdk/usr/include then paste bits folder (has included stdc++.h header from this git). Get back to Xcode, It'll work.
